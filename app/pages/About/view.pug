    | I'm an independent teamworker strong in research and coding.I've worked with a wide variety of programming languages. For web applications I use HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, though I am learning PHP. Whenever I need the most performance possible I obviously go with C/C++ and finally when I am building prototypes or working on my hobby projects I fall back on Python.
